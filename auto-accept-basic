// This script is meant to notice, when a new invitation for a quest is online and instantly accept the quest invitation. 
//
// Requirements for this script to work are:  
// (1) to set up a webhook-server: 
//     - script.google.com offers an easy way to do this:
//     - open script.google.com in a web-browser. 
//     - create a new project (this will happen automatically if this is your fist google script) 
//     - paste this code snippet into the google script. 
//     - save this script as a new version. Read here: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web
//     - deploy the script as a web-app. Read here, also: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web
//     - ! execute the script as "yourself"
//     - ! grant acces to everyone, even anonymous. 
//           (please evaluate for youself about security issues.) 
//           (You might want to use a bot-character for this)
//           (Auto accept quest invitation cannot work if using a bot character)
//     - click "accept". In the following screen: copy the url-snippet (ending with "exec"). This is your webook-url! You need this for step 2!
//     - done
//     - each time you edit the script, it has to be saved as a new version and the new version has to be deployes as a web-app again. 
//
// (2) to set up a Habitica-Webhook: 
//     - To set up a webhook, you can use the tool: API-Helper on github: https://github.com/PitiTheGrey/Habitica-Api-Helper
//     - The webhook has to be set up as "questActivity" and has to have webhook-options set to the following criteria: 
//         - for noticing, when a quest has finished, webhook-option "questFinished" has to be set to true. (true has to be coded as boolean without double-quotes). 
//         - for noticing, when a quest invitation in online, the webhook-option "questInvited" has to be set to true.  
//         - provide the url-snippet of the google-apps-script from (1) as url (ends with "exec")
//         - click "create"
//         - click "display" to check if options are set correctly (copy and paste id if you'd like to delete the webhook. 
//         - done
//
